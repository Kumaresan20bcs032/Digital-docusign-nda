Then (subject to the Vendor and MXC not mutually agreeing otherwise), the Vendor must pay and/or procure the payment/issue of the following to MXC (and/or its nominees) in satisfaction of the Fees at completion of the Transaction:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>    
                  • $6,000 cash (being 6% of the total cash consideration);
                  </li>

            </div>
            <p>
              (iii) (Earn-in or Joint Venture) if the Transaction is an earn-in and/or joint venture arrangement and the includes the Buyer(s) (or any third parties) paying Consideration to the Vendor (and/or a Vendor Associate) in respect of the Transaction, then the Vendor must satisfy the Fees by way of paying or transferring to MXC in respect of Consideration, cash or Securities (based on either 6% for an Introduced Buyer, and a Buyer Connection, of the cash or total number of Securities being issued as Consideration) in the same manner as set out in sub-clauses (i), (ii) above or (iv) below; 
            </p>
            <p>
              (iv) (Deferred Consideration): to be paid in cash and/or Securities after the initial completion of the Transaction, the Vendor must satisfy the payment of the Fees by way of procuring the payment or transfer to MXC (and/or its nominees) of its portion of the cash or Securities (in the same proportion which the Vendor receives) when the Vendor receives the deferred consideration.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Notwithstanding the requirements of this clause, the Vendor and MXC may (in their absolute discretion) mutually agree a cash payment to be paid by the Vendor to MXC (and/or its nominees) in substitution of any or all of the Fees that may be settled by way of cash, Securities, deferred consideration or future JV Expenditure.
          </p>
          <p>
            (c) Except in respect of restricted Securities Fees related to JV Expenditure (the timing for payment of which is provided for in sub-clause (b)(ii)(B) above), the Vendor must pay the Fees to MXC (and/or its nominees), or must procure the payment of the Fees to MXC (and/or its nominees) from the Buyer (or Buyer Associate or relevant third party), on the same day on which the Vendor (and/or the Vendor’s Associates) receive any part of the Consideration in respect of a Transaction (Payment Date). 
          </p>
          <p>
            (d) For the avoidance of doubt, the total Fees due and payable by the Vendor to MXC under this clause is based on the total value of the Consideration which the Vendor (and/or Vendor Associates) may receive under the Transaction, even though some or all of the Consideration may be conditional or contingent on future actions (of third parties) at some time after Completion. However, the Vendor’s obligation to pay the Fees to MXC is subject to the Payment Date, being the date on which the Vendor (and/or the Vendor’s Associate) actually receives that part of the Consideration.
